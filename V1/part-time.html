  <p>🍽️ <strong>Operations Assistant – De.Wan 4-Star Event Restaurant</strong><br><br>
    <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
    I worked 10-hour shifts at De.Wan, a 4-star event-based restaurant, where I supported both front-of-house and back-of-house operations.

During peak service, I attended to guests directly, responding to their needs and ensuring their experience met high service standards. This hands-on role sharpened my stamina, attention to detail, and professionalism in a high-pressure hospitality environment.
